	No ontology accessible from the gff file header!
	We use the SOFA ontology distributed with AGAT:

	Read ontology /lustre/home/ecp226/anaconda3/envs/agat/lib/site_perl/5.26.2/auto/share/dist/AGAT/so.obo:
		4 root terms, and 2472 total terms, and 1436 leaf terms
	Filtering ontology:
		We found 1757 terms that are sequence_feature or is_a child of it.

the parent attribute for the subfeatures because we do not know to which L1
they are really linked to. As it is now we will probably end up with chimeric records.

WARNING - Feature types not expected by AGAT:
* d_loop
The feature of these types (3rd column in GFF3) are skipped by the parser!
To take them into account you must update the feature json files. To access the 
json files run:
			agat_convert_sp_gxf2gxf.pl --expose
In which file to add my feature?
* Feature level1 (e.g. gene, match, region):
  My feature has no parent
  => features_level1.json
* Feature level2 (e.g. mrna, match_part, trna):
  My feature has one parent and children
  => features_level2.json.
* Feature level3 (e.g. exon, intron, cds):
  My feature has one parent (the parent has also a parent) and no children
  => features_level3.json.
* Feature level3 discontinuous (e.g. cds, utr):
  A single feature that exists over multiple genomic locations
  => features_spread.json.
